## Have read ##

### Fiction

* Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell - Big brother is watching you.
* Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse - lent to me by Rajesh Hanbal. Actually read it after many years because several others recommended it. I didn't find it particularly interesting at all. Probably because I read too much spirituality while growing up.
* നിരീശ്വരന്‍ - വി ജെ ജെയിംസ്  - Pirate Praveen gave me this book. It is a very funny story about God.
