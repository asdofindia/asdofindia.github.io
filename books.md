## Have read ##

### Fiction

* Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell - Big brother is watching you.

* Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse - lent to me by Rajesh Hanbal. Actually read it after many years because several others recommended it. I didn't find it particularly interesting at all. Probably because I read too much spirituality while growing up.
