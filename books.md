## Have read ##

### Non-fiction

* The Diary of a Young Girl - I don't remember about it because I read it when I was very young.
* Night by Eli Wiesel - a horror story in 56 pages that makes you lose sleep for days.
* My Experiments with Truth by MK Gandhi - the idea of truth giving courage and strength and non-violence triggering the moral conscience of opponents. The idea that one can experiment with things in one's own life (n=1 studies, anyone?).
* The Doctor and The Saint by Arundathi Roy - helped break the idol called MK Gandhi
* Annihilation of Caste - [full review](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2020/12/annihilation-of-caste.html)
* A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking - A very nice book about physics.
* One Two Three... Infinity by George Gamow - A very nice book about science/mathematics.

### Fiction

* Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell - Big brother is watching you.
* Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse - lent to me by Rajesh Hanbal. Actually read it after many years because several others recommended it. I didn't find it particularly interesting at all. Probably because I read too much spirituality while growing up.
* നിരീശ്വരന്‍ - വി ജെ ജെയിംസ്  - Pirate Praveen gave me this book. It is a very funny story about God.
* God of Small Things by Arundathi Roy - I read it when I was very young and I don't remember anything about the book.
* Harry Potter series by JK Rowling - I grew up reading these books and they're truly magical.
* To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - The story of Atticus and Scout and Jem and Maycomb and systemic violence and morals.
