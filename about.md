# Curriculum Vitae / Resume / Portfolio #

I do not believe in CVs, but apparently it is important.

## Traditional Education ##

### National Law School of India University, Bangalore ###

**Post Graduate Diploma in Medical Law & Ethics**
(October 2018 - present)

### Vivekananda Memorial Hospital, Saragur ###

**Fellowship in HIV Medicine**
(August 2017 - July 2018)

SVYM [rekindled my ambitions](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2017/05/rekindling-ambitions.html). I became a much better doctor here, learning from some of the best doctors I have ever met. The team here was incredible and I continue to be associated with them. I did a thesis project titled "Why do PLHIV fall sick in the era of ART" which was a qualitative project. The [LaTeX version is online](https://gitlab.com/plhiv-still-sick/2018-mysore). I could manage anyone who came in through the emergency department door (and anyone who came out of pregnant ladies). I managed NICU (including CPAP), deliveries (including receiving newborns some of whom needed resuscitation), trauma (including patients who received ICD), reduction of fractures and dislocations, myocardial infarcts (my god, how many code blues!), bleeding pregnant ladies, severely asthmatic, COPD, sepsis, AIDS of the impossible to be alive stage. I did scores of lumbar punctures, pleural tapping, abdominal tapping. Did a few central line placements, FAST scans. Assisted scores of orthopaedic surgeries (and a few obstetric and general). Mentored medical interns from various medical schools. Managed nursing teams. Was the convenor of CPR committee. Drafted the ACS protocol. I also managed general medicine OPD on days when physician was not available. Did multiple case presentations (we had case presentations every week in grand rounds). I love SVYM (Vivekananda Memorial Hospital) for making me the doctor I am. I believe the year and half I spent here was equivalent to doing first year of postgraduation in Paediatrics, OBG, Medicine, and Surgery.

### Mysore Medical College & Research Institute, Mysore ###

**Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery**
(August 2011 - March 2017)

This is the place where I became an adult. I got disillusioned. I found love. I learned all sorts of things in medicine and programming. I learned a lot about people. I learned a lot about health. I met my mentors.

In the first year here I learned Kannada. I bought a cycle. I would run around [Kukkarahalli Kere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukkarahalli_Lake) without stopping. I started my medical blog.

By second year I was volunteering at [Kaliyuva Mane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliyuva_Mane_School,_Mysore). I started a facebook group called [talking about sex](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2012/07/complaining-about-rape.html) for what I believed required to be done against rape. I continued to read hundreds of blogs. I bought a [better cycle](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2013/01/new-year-new-heights-new-directions.html). I applied for ICMR's STS and got selected, but my study "Prevalence and pattern of sexual abuse in college going women in Mysore and its impact on their mental health" was not approved by my college's ethics committee. My interest switched [from neurology to research in cognitive science](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2013/05/a-lot-can-happen-over-coffee.html). I got attracted to a [new style of quizzing](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2013/05/two-ways-to-go-crazy.html). I also stopped giving a shit to my college.

In third year I became [mozillian](https://learnlearn.in/mozillian/). I got attracted to the free software movement. I started contributing to various free software projects. Though I had given up on my college, I still did a lot of work in [magazine club](https://savyasaachi.github.io/). I did "[A study on the respiratory effects in road construction workers](https://www.ijcmph.com/index.php/ijcmph/article/view/2021)". And I failed in two subjects (ENT and opthal, you freaks, how does knowing that help you?) of medical school.

In final year, everything was at their peak. I was [talking to people](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2015/07/healthcare-policy-or-technology-or-people.html) about health, I was developing [chat bots](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2015/08/response-to-whatsapp-cease-and-desist-threat.html), I was becoming hard core free software promoter, I became the administrator of [Mozilla India blog](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2015/09/did-i-screw-up-mozilla-india-blogs.html), I passed those third year subjects (after two night-outs. Really it is all it took and I didn't do it the first time because of my firm belief that learning should not be just for exams). I got selected by Mozilla to attend leadership summit in London (and Singapore). But UK denied my visa and Singapore I had to skip because of clash with my university exams.

Right after my final year exam, I went on a one-month North India trip. I went to [Rajasthan](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2016/02/), [Agra & Delhi](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2016/03/), [Uttarakhand](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2016/07/), and then Bhutan through Siliguri. (Still have a few pending blog posts from this trip). And then internship started. It was dog work. Running around, doing things, running around, and more sleepless running arounds. I suppose I picked up quite a few practical skills during this time.

### Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Kannur ###

**Senior Secondary School**
(June 2009 - March 2011)

The two years in Chinmaya were very very interesting. One, I started blogging prolifically because a few of my classmates expressed deep interest in what I write. Two, I started to get a larger perspective in life.

I was school leader in 12th standard. I would continue participating in sports and literary activities but the competition here was tougher. But I still represented my school in some quizzes and won many. I wanted to continue my love of maths, but I had joined T.I.M.E. for entrance coaching for medicine and kind of lost interest in maths. Did not score 100 in board exam. Neither did I in Physics (which had by then become my favourite). Got an entrance rank in 1000s and got into medical school in the first attempt.


#### Achievements ####

* Reached interview stage of [KVPY](http://kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/) - I regret to have not being able to qualify because I thoroughly messed up the interview. But in the long run, maybe it was good because if I had won KVPY I would have joined IISc and that would have probably led to a different life altogether (no offense meant to IISc, LOL).
* [INOI 2011 qualifier](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/2011/inoi2011/results_inoi2011.php) - the training camp for selection to [IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/) that followed brought me in close touch with several people good at algorithms and that propelled the programmer in me.
* Rank 1675 in [All India Pre-Medical Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Pre_Medical_Test) - CBSE was the best people in tests. I lost interest in taking tests after I stopped taking tests by CBSE. Rank 1475 in Kerala's [KEAM](http://cee-kerala.org/)

### Sree Sankara Vidya Peetham, Mattanur ##

**Higher Secondary School, Upper Primary School, Lower Primary School**
(June 1999 - April 2009)

I was good in studies and was rank 1 in many classes. My friends were good too and it was always fierce competition for the best ranks. I would always end up with proficiency prize. Mathematics was my favourite subject with me getting 100/100 most times (including 10th standard board exam). My father had infused enough responsibility in me that I would help others learn too. I specifically remember sitting with a classmate in my home and teaching him how to add fractions on the days before exams in high school.

I was a scout. I was the school leader (on some days when the higher class students were absent). I used to be inspired, speak, and be on the front line in cleaning on Gandhi Jayanthi, Independence Day, and Republic Day. After school time, if I was not playing football I would have been in the library reading. When it came to cultural day, I would suddenly start practising singing, declamation, and writing. Once I represented my school in classical music at district level. Twice I represented my school in sports (including chess). And so many quizzes!

This is also the time I started loving computers. I was fascinated beyond words by [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) running in one computer of my school's computer lab. I learned the basics of programming while in school. Around [8th standard](https://learnlearn.in/keep-in-touch/) I got a computer at home and that gave me superpowers.

#### Achievements ####

* [Rashtrapati scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Award) - mine is from Pratibha Patil. I really value being a scout as it taught me incredible life lessons. I also participated in a state level Camporee in Calicut University grounds.
* [National Talent Search scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Talent_Search_Examination) - more than the scholarship, the 10 day camp at SCERT of Kerala was a unique opportunity in my life. I met many of the best students at my age there.
