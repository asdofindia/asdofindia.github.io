title: Moving Blissful Life to a Domain Name I Control

I've owned a domain name (learnlearn.in) for a long time now. Yet, my blog Blissful Life hosted on blogspot at asdofindia.blogspot.com was my primary means of writing till today.

I had moved to using learnlearn.in [a few months back](http://learnlearn.in/keep-in-touch/) but I was using it mainly like a wiki to collect knowledge and insights.

Today, I added the [blog.learnlearn.in](http://blog.learnlearn.in) subdomain to Blissful Life. And it was smooth! I just [added a CNAME entry](https://support.google.com/blogger/troubleshooter/1233381) to my DNS pointing `blog` to `ghs.google.com` and voilah!

Blogger seems to be redirecting all articles to the new URL without any problem.

Now, should Blogger be shut down by Google, all I need to do is parse the XML of the blog backup and set up the posts to be served at the correct URLs.

I finally have a fully decentralized Web presence - a website, a blog, and [my social feed](../social-feed/).
