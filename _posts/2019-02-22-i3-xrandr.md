##### i3 is my favourite window manager (and desktop environment). When I connect an external monitor or projector to my laptop, though, xrandr comes to the rescue on how they should work with each other #####

By default when an external monitor, say VGA-1, is connected to the laptop, i3 puts one workspace on that. If it does not do it automatically, the way to do it is with:

```bash
$ xrandr --output VGA-1 --right-of LVDS-1 --auto
```

This puts VGA-1 to the right of LVDS-1 (which maybe the name of the internal monitor of the laptop).

What if I just want to fold my laptop and use i3 completely on the external monitor or projector?

```bash
$ xrandr --output LVDS-1 --off --output VGA-1 --auto
```

How to turn the internal monitor back on?

```bash
$ xrandr --output LVDS-1 --auto
```

Now, what if I still want one workspace on the internal monitor?

```bash
$ xrandr --output LVDS-1 --right-of VGA-1 --auto
```
