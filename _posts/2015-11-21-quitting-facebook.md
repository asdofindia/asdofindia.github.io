I [permanently deleted](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674/) my Facebook account like a few days back. It's scheduled to be deleted from their server on 23rd, but I'm not sure they'll delete my data.

Of the [various reasons I deleted the account](//learnlearn.in/facebook/) the most important is censorship and the fact that they are actively killing the open Web.

And good news follows.

Fellow Mozillian [Ruwaiz deleted his account too](https://twitter.com/RUWAIZRAZAK/status/667569312497057793) and [wrote about why he did it](http://beingrez.com/why-i-quit-facebook/).

Also I received [this newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=da6fdd71afbd94ce75c8ce2f5&id=80b1cb1dcf&e=3a866c284a) from Laura today where she says she's ~~maybe~~ definitely anti-Facebook.

So, when are you [deleting your Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674/) and strengthening the open Web?
