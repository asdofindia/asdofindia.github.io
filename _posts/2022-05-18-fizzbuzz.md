##### FizzBuzz is fairly easy. But that's where you can put constraints on it. Spoiler alert: Don't read this if you want to figure some of these out yourself. #####

## The problem, recap

For numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and the number itself for others. (Goes without saying that when the number is divisible by 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz")

## Solutions 

### Using match and guard (rust)

```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        match (i % 3, i % 5) {
            (0, 0) => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            (0, _) => println!("Fizz"),
            (_, 0) => println!("Buzz"),
            (_, _) => println!("{i}")
        }
    }
}
```

### Using mutation (python)

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    x = ""
    if i % 3 == 0: x = "Fizz"
    if i % 5 == 0: x = x + "Buzz"
    if x == "": x = str(i)
    print(x)
```

### Using closures and array indexing (javascript)

```js
const print = (a, b, c) => console.log(a + b || c)

const counter = (list) => (i) => list[i % list.length]
const three = counter(["","","Fizz"])
const five = counter(["","","","","Buzz"])

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    print(three(i), five(i), i+1);
}
```

Or slightly differently

```js
const print = (a, b, c) => console.log(a + b || c)

const counter = (at, word) => (i) => i % at === 0 ? word : ""
const three = counter(3, "Fizz")
const five = counter(5, "Buzz")

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    print(three(i), five(i), i);
}
```

### Using repetition (python)

```python
for i in range(0, 7):
    x = i * 15
    print(x + 1)
    print(x + 2)
    print("Fizz")
    print(x + 4)
    print("Buzz")
    print("Fizz")
    print(x + 7)
    print(x + 8)
    print("Fizz")
    print("Buzz")
    if i == 6: continue
    print(x + 11)
    print("Fizz")
    print(x + 13)
    print(x + 14)
    print("FizzBuzz")
```

### Using multiplication table and set intersection (python)

```python
threes = set(x * 3 for x in range(0, 34))
fives = set(x * 5 for x in range(0, 21))
fifteens = threes.intersection(fives)
d = {
    **dict.fromkeys(threes, "Fizz"),
    **dict.fromkeys(fives, "Buzz"),
    **dict.fromkeys(fifteens, "FizzBuzz")
}

for i in range(1, 101):
    print(d.get(i, str(i)))
```

### Using carriage returns (python)

This might not pass certain automated tests.

But for a human the output is right.

It is like the mutation solution, except it happens on the tty.

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i, end='\r')
    if i % 3 == 0: print("Fizz", end="")
    if i % 5 == 0: print("Buzz", end="")
    print()
```

### Mask

```python
m = ("..f.bf..fb.f..z" * 7)[0:100]
d = {'f': "Fizz", 'b': "Buzz", 'z': "FizzBuzz"}

for i, x in enumerate(list(m)):
    print(d.get(x, i+1))
```

That can actually be shortened to this one-liner

```python
print(*[{'f': "Fizz", 'b': "Buzz", 'z': "FizzBuzz"}.get(x,i+1) for i,x in enumerate(list(("..f.bf..fb.f..z" * 7)[0:100]))], sep='\n')
```

### Using mathematics for mask

I took help [from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/mdoro/comment/c303htx/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for this

```python
for x in range(100):
    print(x % 3 // 2 * "Fizz" + x % 5 // 4 * "Buzz" or x + 1)
```

This works because `//` operator can only give the integer part of the division. So, it returns 1 every 3rd or 5th iteration. `or` works like `||` in javascript.
