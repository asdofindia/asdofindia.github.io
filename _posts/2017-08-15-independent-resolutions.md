##### Like all independence days, today has been about resolutions for me. #####

Back when I was a dumbly patriotic school kid, national holidays were the most important days for me. I would religiously sing Vande Mataram and Jana Gana Mana. As a scout, it was my duty to make sure everyone celebrates independence day with the joy it should bring.

And it was [pure love](http://blog.learnlearn.in/2009/02/valentines-day-i-love-girl.html). I would get hurt when people [feared my country instead of loving it](http://blog.learnlearn.in/2009/03/do-you-love-your-nation-or-fear-her.html).

Slowly and surely I [stopped being too patriotic](http://blog.learnlearn.in/2010/02/meaning-of-patriotism-in-global.html). A great deal of this "anti-national" tendency has been propelled by the stupidities that our society bears in the name of nationalism and patriotism. With years passing by and new political conditions, the feeling has only gotten stronger.

These days, while I try not to appear too aloof from independence day celebrations, I make it a point to [be resolute and work towards the betterment of my country in my own ways](http://blog.learnlearn.in/2010/08/i-do-not-deserve-right-to-wish-you.html). (The only selfish reason for it being that I can retort to "patriots" who force me to "observe independence day" in a certain way that I have the right to celebrate it in my own way because I contribute to the growth of India.)

So what did I do this independence day?

Apart from resolving to be productive, I slept for 4 hours in the afternoon, and wrote a couple of blog posts - one about [my spirituality](https://learnlearn.in/spirituality/) and the other about [the FHM interview](https://mbbshacker.blogspot.com/2017/08/fellowship-in-hiv-medicine-interview.html).

I also compiled the [protocols I have been working on at VMH](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_AnnRxo14Xhdk9XOThHc1ZIY3M) in a public folder. Comments welcome.

So, the resolutions are:
* Work in the open and keep working.
* Keep writing and inspire others.
* Aim for continuous improvement, not perfection.
* Keep the phone alarm away from the bed.
