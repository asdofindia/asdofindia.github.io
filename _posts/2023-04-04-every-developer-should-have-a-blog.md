- Because they can write small snippets of code or commands and refer it.
- Because they can document a tough problem they solved (for others and for themselves in the future).
- Because they can identify their own growth by looking at the old posts.
- Because they can improve their communication skills.
- Because they can build a portfolio.
- Because they can refer to it in many places.
- Because they can have hyperlinks.
- Because they can maintain a website.
- Because they can.
