##### Is it worth going to a different country for a "better" life? Or are there costs that are hidden till when one looks back? #####

Deepak Unnikrishnan, the author of *[Temporary People](https://restlessbooks.org/bookstore/temporary-people)*, has written a moving article titled [The Hidden Cost of Migrant Labor](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2020-02-07/hidden-cost-migrant-labor): What It Means to Be a Temporary Person in the Gulf. The author's parents spend their youth in a country where they never became full citizens.
