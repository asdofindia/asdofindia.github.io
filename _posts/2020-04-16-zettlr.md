##### Zettlr is a beautiful markdown editor that I discovered just today (and I'm already writing about it) #####

I saw zettlr through Jaseem's tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/zettlr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zettlr</a> is a pretty nice markdown editor, might stick with this for a while.</p>&mdash; Jaseem Abid ü¶Ä (@jaseemabid) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaseemabid/status/1250072559682490374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


It is open source and the philosophy is amazing:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Zettlr‚Äôs model is called solidarity: Everybody must be able to use the app for free, but anyone who wants me to be able to pay my rent can do so. To quote:<br><br>‚ÄúFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.‚Äù</p>&mdash; Zettlr (@zettlr) <a href="https://twitter.com/zettlr/status/1245788051726651392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Features I love ##

I have only been using the app for a day, and these are the features I already love

* Opens an entire directory in one go
* Can read YAML frontmatter and use the "title" field to display as file name.
* Inline preview of markdown (what you type is automatically formatted according to markdown formatting style)
* Readable file based project metadata
* Dark mode
* Libre software (GPLv3), great philosophy

There are even more features like:
* Export in various formats (including pdf)
* Buttons to format
* Search, virtual directories, and so on.
