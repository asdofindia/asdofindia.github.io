##### Firefox extensions add useful functionality that saves time #####

I just read Ludovic's [post about which Firefox extensions they have](https://www.hirlimann.net/Ludovic/carnet/?post/2018/12/21/December-2018-what-extensions-do-I-use-in-Firefox-dsktop). Here are the extensions installed on my firefox desktop that I use extensively. In alphabetic order.

#### [Auto Tab Discard](https://add0n.com/tab-discard.html) ####

Automatically sends tabs I have not visited in past n minutes (n=10 for me) into a suspended state (like they are when you reopen firefox after closing it with a lot of tabs). This lets me have thousands of tabs open but still run light on memory. The snoozed tabs are automatically activated when I come back to them.

#### [Behind The Overlay Revival](https://github.com/ivanruvalcaba/BehindTheOverlayRevival) ####

I have not used this extensively, but it closes annoying popups on websites with a simple click in the URL bar

#### [ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/) ####

Installed this recently to pick a colour from a PDF to reproduce it in word processing software

#### [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers#readme) ####

This is a godsend extension by Mozilla themselves (which graduated out of TestPilot) that allows me to have different containers for different accounts on same website. For example, I have a "Work" container in which I am logged in to google, twitter, etc as my organization. I open a tab in this container whenever I want to do some work related activity.

#### [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) ####

Ghostery is my ad-blocker of choice (for now)

#### [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) ####

This simple add-on automatically redirects popular websites that support https to their https version. Silently runs in the background.

#### [Mastodon Simplified Federation](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation) ####

I installed this yesterday because entering my mastodon account details for following people was quickly becoming a pain when I discovered [Trunk](https://communitywiki.org/trunk/)

#### [Modify Header Value](https://mybrowseraddon.com/modify-header-value.html) ####

There are many add-ons that does this. I wanted this feature because there were sites that would block content unless you entered the site through google search. I set a 'referer' header on those sites with value 'https://www.google.com' and easily got through.

#### [TestPilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com/) ####

I regularly run interesting experiments through Test Pilot. Currently I have:
* [Email Tabs](https://github.com/mozilla/email-tabs/) - which I used exactly once after installing
* [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com/) - also which I used exactly once in a Firefox release party to show off

#### [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) ####

Although I have [open access button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) installed as well, it is unpaywall which effortlessly puts a link to legal full text PDF on journals that insist on logging in for accessing content.

#### [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) ####

I don't like to use my laptop's touchpad. I don't like to use mouse either. Vimium makes it possible to browse the entire web with just keyboard.

#### [Wayback Machine](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/) ####

I got this from Ludovic's post and just installed. The power of wayback machine automatically.

#### [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/) ####

Best reference management tool ever.
