##### If you are someone who likes many things, there is a good chance that you get distracted and end up doing nothing that you like. Deciding to focus on a few things at a time can be useful #####

I did an exercise of deciding to set my mission and priorities for 2019 yesterday.

### My mission for 2019 ###

Improving healthcare through evidence based innovation, especially technological innovations, in primary care and public health; and facilitating the same for others through services, advocacy, research, and training

### Priorities ###

1. Co-lead practice innovation and scholarship in the family health center.[^fhc] Scale-up primary care services, advocacy, research, and training (through partners wherever necessary and/or possible).

2. Establish and lay the ground work for AFPI National Center for Primary Care Research and Policy.

[^fhc]: I have not written about it yet. [PCMH](https://www.pcmhrestorehealth.com) is going to soon start a family health center at a new location.

### Time-split ###

These require a lot of work to be done. My task list is constantly evolving. A rough estimate of how time needs to be spent, for now, comes in the ratio **14:8:3** for clinic based work, writing work, and professional tech work.
