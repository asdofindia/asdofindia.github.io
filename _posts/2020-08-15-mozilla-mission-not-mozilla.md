##### Mozilla might fail as a company or an organization. But Mozilla's mission is too important to fail #####


Mozilla maybe a shitty organization. I've personally stopped caring about the Mozilla foundation and corporation [long back](/why-no-mozilla/).

But Mozilla's mission is absolutely critical to the human kind.

Here's [Mozilla's mission](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/):

> "Ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."

And the Internet today is at great threat from governments all over the world.

India is regularly banning websites. And not just porn. Websites like [FridaysForFuture and LetIndiaBreathe](https://theprint.in/india/our-websites-blocked-say-3-environmental-groups-campaigning-against-contentious-draft-policy/460530/). The telecom sector is moving towards being an Ambani monopoly. And the state denies [millions of citizens access to internet](https://www.thekashmirmonitor.net/i-day-low-speed-2g-internet-shut-in-kashmir/). That's just India.

The Internet is a remarkable human feat. Something that has revolutionized the human existence. We have to protect it. And Mozilla isn't the only organization that can lead that fight.

I'll list some organizations I know which you might want to read about:

* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
* [Internet Freedom Foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/)
* [Software Freedom Law Centre](https://sflc.in/)

Mozilla is still important. They have to continue working on Firefox to make sure that Google doesn't get to dominate the browser space with Chrome.

But the greater threats to internet as of this Indian independence day are things that have to be dealt in the policy space (and not purely technology). And therefore, it maybe a good time to think beyond Mozilla. So that you can protect Mozilla's mission.
