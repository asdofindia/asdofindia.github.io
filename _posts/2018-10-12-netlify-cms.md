For the past few weeks I had been searching, searching, searching for adding a backend to my site. I had used [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) in the past but I did not want to use it because I thought it was tied up with netlify. But, boy, was I wrong?

Netlify CMS can be used entirely independent of netlify. You can directly login through gitlab (or github/bitbucket). It is not mandatory to use the netlify identity service.

What is even more cool is that it is amazingly easy to deploy.

This post is from the frontend. Or backend?
