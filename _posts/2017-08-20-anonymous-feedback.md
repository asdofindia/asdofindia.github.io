##### Riding on the Sarahah wave, the author invites constructive feedback from readers and acquaintances for personal improvement. #####

I have written in the past about [proactive change and three kinds of people based on their willingness to change](http://blog.learnlearn.in/2012/07/proactive-change.html).

Feedback from others helps people improve in their social life. Improving social life may not always be a priority for people though.

Anyhow, now that this is the season for it, I would be really happy if you can give me useful feedback - things you like or hate about me, things you would appreciate I change, etc.
