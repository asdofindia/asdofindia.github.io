##### Instant wisdom is a rule or axiom created on the fly, especially by people of authority, which has no real basis in reason or cause #####

Children, students, and juniors are frequently at the receiving end of several do's and don'ts meted out to them by elders, teachers, and seniors. While a lot of these are folk wisdom and genuine advice based on experience and knowledge, not all of them are.

I was trying to think of an example. But it seems like I have so low regard for instant wisdom that when anyone gives such advice without reason, I instantly forget it too.

But, keep an eye out. Next time someone gives a piece of advice in a knee-jerky fashion without giving a proper reason why you should follow it, be wary that it could be instant wisdom and like many things instant, not very good.
