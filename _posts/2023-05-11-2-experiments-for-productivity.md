##### This blog post explores the benefits of new habits and experimentation for increased productivity and efficiency. #####

While I acknowledge that productivity is often tied to capitalist ideals and can perpetuate harmful systems, I also recognize that for me personally, being productive helps me feel accomplished and satisfied with my work. With this in mind, I've been exploring new habits and experiments to help me be more efficient and effective in my pursuits.

Recently, I decided to embark on two new experiments to see if they would be beneficial to me. The first experiment involves reducing my phone usage. I realized that I was spending too much time scrolling through social media and checking my phone constantly throughout the day. This was not only impacting my productivity but also my overall well-being. To address this, I set specific times to check social media and avoid using my phone in bed. I hope that this experiment will help me to be more mindful of my phone usage and improve my overall quality of life.

The second experiment is related to writing. I was intrigued by the recent criticism of using AI to generate content. Paul Graham, a renowned entrepreneur and investor, expressed concern that using AI for content generation would result in [people no longer thinking for themselves](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1655925905527537666). While I don't completely agree with this perspective, I decided to explore the use of AI assistance for writing.

While I don't necessarily believe that using AI will make me a better writer, I was curious about the technology and wanted to have some fun with it. By using AI to assist with writing, I hope to generate ideas faster and get a first draft down quicker. While I don't plan on relying solely on AI for my writing, I think it will be an interesting experiment to see what kind of content the AI produces.

In conclusion, exploring new habits and experimenting with different approaches can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Whether it's reducing phone usage or using AI assistance for writing, it's important to remain open to new ideas and willing to try new things. I look forward to sharing the results of my experiments in the future.
