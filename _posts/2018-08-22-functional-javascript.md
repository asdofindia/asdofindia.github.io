##### Are stateless functions the sexiest? #####

While reading about [test driven development](../test-driven-development) I came across the idea of functional javascript.

This four part series on it was my starting point:

* Part 1: [Building blocks and motivation](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-intro/)
* Part 2: [Working with Arrays and Lists](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-arrays/)
* Part 3: [Functions for making functions](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-functions/)
* Part 4: [Doing it with style](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-style/)


## What is functional javascript?

It is a way of writing javascript such that functions are passed around to other functions as parameters.

## How is it useful?

It is incredibly useful in doing repetitive tasks fairly easily (see map, reduce functions in part 2 of the series)

Along the way I glanced upon this [beautiful book on JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) as well.
