##### Twitter forces users to cut words, sometimes at the expense of losing meaning. This creates confusion and polarization. This is bad. #####

Starting today, I will not directly compose posts on Twitter. (I had tried to do this [earlier](/blogs-to-chat/), but I would continue retweeting, making threads, etc). But a few things happened in the past month which has made me realize that Twitter has deep issues.

### Reason 1

A tweet I made went viral.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The government of India has not made Aarogya Setu app&#39;s source code open source. It has set up a fake repository with code that is similar to the original source code of Aarogya Setu. This is a lie. <a href="https://t.co/TKObKhgiAa">https://t.co/TKObKhgiAa</a></p>&mdash; Akshay S Dinesh (@asdofindia) <a href="https://twitter.com/asdofindia/status/1266566128496553984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This tweet was made in a specific context. The context was that the original development of Aarogya Setu was happening on a private repository and the code in the public repository was just a snapshot. And that's what the quoted tweet was supposed to show.

But as soon as it started getting retweets I realized that people are reading what I wrote in a different way. They were thinking that the government had put a completely different source code tree in place of Aarogya Setu's Android source code. It would fit their worldview that the current government is corrupt and full of lies.

I realized it and made a [video](/aarogya-setu-reproducible-build/) that demonstrates that the code that was made public corresponded 99.9% to the original application. But I don't know if people care any more.

Later, in an article on FirstPost, I could make my statement correctly: [Aarogya Setu not â€˜open sourceâ€™ in real sense, claim cybersecurity activists, say server code must be made public](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/aarogya-setu-not-open-source-in-real-sense-claim-cybersecurity-activists-say-server-code-must-be-made-public-8480011.html).

Of course, without twitter none of this would have happened. People would think that Aarogya Setu's development is fully transparent and so on. But I cannot ignore the problems twitter created here.

### Reason 2

A research poster had to be summarized in a tweet and everyone started attacking the research itself.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vegetarian women more likely to have probability of nutrient adequacy &amp; diet diversity during pregnancy than non-vegetarian women.<br>Poster presented at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NUTRITIONLIVEONLINE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NUTRITIONLIVEONLINE</a> 2020 is a collab study by <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnsHopkinsSPH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JohnsHopkinsSPH</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/IFPRI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IFPRI</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UttarPradesh?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UttarPradesh</a>, India.<br>ðŸ‘‰<a href="https://t.co/x3skN61yMa">https://t.co/x3skN61yMa</a> <a href="https://t.co/BAxB9xsH6O">pic.twitter.com/BAxB9xsH6O</a></p>&mdash; POSHAN (@POSHANsm) <a href="https://twitter.com/POSHANsm/status/1268074050468712449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The original poster's title is "Self-Identified Vegetarian Pregnant Women in India Have Better Diets Than Self-Identified Non-Vegetarian Women Because of the Intersections of Caste and Economic Status". But, many started reading the tweet in the light of the current government's fascist outlook. Respectful engagement is not a word in Twitterverse.

## Putting it together

Twitter enforces conciseness. Nuanced ideas cannot be expressed in concise terms. Hence nuance is lost on Twitter.

When nuance is lost, misreading becomes easy. When misread, a sentence can mean anything based on the outlook of the reader. This is breeding ground for polarization.

This works well for Twitter.

But this is bad for humans.

## Plan

I stop using Twitter to compose tweets.

I will compose things on my [blogs](/about/) and post links on twitter. Even if that is for replying to a tweet.
