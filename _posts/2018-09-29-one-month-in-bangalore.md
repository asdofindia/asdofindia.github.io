I did know what [my goals](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2018/08/what-next.html) were while moving to Bangalore. But I had [no idea what I was going to do](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2018/09/bridges-bridges-everywhere.html) about them. This is how things have been.

After days of searching, shifting, shifting again, fighting bed bugs and so on, Swathi and I found a home in Mathikere and I promptly changed my couchsurfing status to "Accpeting Guests".

I now go regularly to [Paisool](https://paisool.com/) where I have been programming solutions to interesting problems since January. Their new office in Halasoor is a lovely place to work in.

I visit [PCMH Restore Health](https://www.pcmhrestorehealth.com/) clinic three days a week in the mornings as a consultant HIV & primary care physician. Most of my work in the coming days will be centered at PCMH.

I am also helping [Institute of Public Health, Bangalore](http://iphindia.org/) in data collection and visualization, primarily on projects that involve tribal health.

The very reason I love Bangalore is the number of interesting events that happen here. For example, I went to [Alternative Law Forum](http://altlawforum.org/) for a [talk on data protection bill](https://twitter.com/vinaysreeni/status/1044131943749566464). This was on the day the [aadhaar judgement](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2018/09/understanding-aadhaar-unconstitutionality.html) came out. I am now looking to work with [internet democracy project](https://internetdemocracy.in/) probably as a collaboration with [Indic Project](http://indicproject.org/). Also, I got myself enrolled in the [post-graduate diploma in medical law & ethics](http://ded.nls.ac.in/post-graduate-diploma-in-medical-law-ethics/) (PGDMLE) offered by National Law School of India University as a distance education programme. This is something I am really looking forward to.

But the most interesting thing I did last month was to start working on the [healthcare app idea](https://mbbshacker.blogspot.com/2018/09/app-based-healthcare-delivery.html). The team at PCMH applied for [Stars in Global Health](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/programs/stars-in-global-health/) grant. Our focus in the first year of operations will be on female commercial sex workers and transgender women. [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/FNxbXp7o4q4) in which I talk more about it. (Turn volume up to hear :P)

That is how things have been. It is getting really interesting.
