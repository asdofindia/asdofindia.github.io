##### You can run your favourite OS on EC2 as well #####

After being tired of [debops](../debops/) for my personal server, I decided that what I wanted was an opinionated, good configuration scheme which I can do myself.

And who else provides it other than ArchLinux!

I figured out if you search "arch-linux" in community AMIs when creating instance you get to install archlinux. (It won't show free tier eligible, but I think that's not because it is not free tier eligible)

If you have difficulty finding the AMIs, direct links available [upstream](https://www.uplinklabs.net/projects/arch-linux-on-ec2/)

Once launched, you can follow [archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page) to your heart's content!
