title: "Religion and Law in India - Questions"
---

#####  What are some things I want to read from an essay about religion and law in India #####

- Where do Indian courts draw the line between religious freedom and other freedoms? How far can the religious arm swing before it becomes a threat to others' nose?
- How much control do I have on what _my religion_ is? Can I declare I'm a Buddhist myself? What about Dinkoist? (Even yesterday I was talking to a colleague saying that there is no document anywhere stating that I belong to a particular religion. The colleague insisted that birth certificates have religion mentioned. I can't find mine. If at all it has, I would like to know how it can be changed.)
- As a follow-up, if someone's parents are from different religion, what religion do they belong to when they're a child? Let's say the parents have a debate about performing (or not) a religious ceremony for the child. If it goes to a court, how does that get settled?
- Talking about Dinkoism, considering all religions are made up, is there any difference between how judiciary looks at Dinkoism and how judiciary looks at established/older religions?
- Where do these judges get _original, authentic_ copies of religious books from?
- What's "secularism" as per law? Is it lack of religion? Is it sum of all religions? Something different?
- Why can't two people get marry and be recognised as married through an online process? Why do they need to follow a religious process, if not the onerous special marriage act?
- What is the actual law on government's use of or participation in religion?
- How far is the idea of the Constitution as a transformational document relevant when it comes to religion and law? Is law transforming religion? Or is it vice versa?
- Are there regional differences in law related to religion within India?
