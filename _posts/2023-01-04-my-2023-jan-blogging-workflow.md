#####  This is how I update this site in 2023 #####

- I have termux installed on Android 
- I have git installed on termux.
- I have the gitlab repo of my Jekyll blog cloned locally.
- I use [markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/) to edit the files with a custom template relevant to my blog.
- I commit and push with termux
- I have setup a webhook with [caddy webhook](https://github.com/WingLim/caddy-webhook) module to do the rest on my server.
