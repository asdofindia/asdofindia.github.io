First, the good news. I am now a Fellow in HIV Medicine. I finished this one year RGUHS course last week and now am taking rest at my home in flood-stricken Kerala. No, there is no danger where my home is, and yes, the food is yummy.

I set up a web server on Amazon Web Services last month and have been hosting my email, websites, and other services on it since then. I have written about these under the ["devops" category](https://asd.learnlearn.in/tag/devops/) on my site. I have to write about SVYM, and my adventurous journey to reach home later.

I have also made all necessary arrangements for recording videos for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2M-cpTDCf9gBbOLd_QLUw). So expect some video action soon.

I re-read "[A Guide for Young People: What to Do With Your Life](https://zenhabits.net/career/)" which is a small blog post by my favorite blogger Leo Babauta. [He is not a Buddhist monk](https://zenhabits.net/my-story/).

And then I decided what I should do with my life. Read "[What Next?](https://blog.learnlearn.in/2018/08/what-next.html)" on my blog. In it I have written about my ambitions, not my plan. I have not been able to plan things with detail till now. But what has helped me throughout is to know the kind of things I want to do. I wish myself the best.

What are you doing? Tell me everything about it.
