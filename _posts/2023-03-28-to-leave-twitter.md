title: "Intention To leave Twitter"
---

#####  I am beginning to feel it is time to leave Twitter. Why? #####

There's a point in every social media where it no longer becomes tenable to use it because the costs are far greater than the benefits.

For Facebook, this happened to me [in 2015](../quitting-facebook) when I had stopped enjoying the content there and also Facebook was actively trying to kill the open web. Facebook's decline in usage would point to the idea that I was at the start of the trend towards the decline.

Quora was very interesting at one point in time. Then it became filled with very low quality questions and answers. I stopped using Quora right at the beginning of this trend.

I like to believe that I adopt new technology fairly early. Perhaps it is also true that I leave obsolete technology fairly early!?

To be in the early leavers curve, one must be able to find symptoms of decline from which a platform cannot recover.

I think I'm beginning to find this for Twitter:

- The visibility is skewed towards blue check accounts and accounts with large following.
- Only low quality content (controversial, emotion-provoking, meaningless) get amplified (similar to Quora amplifying cringe-worthy content)
- The ownership of Twitter has been trying to make even more restrictions for regular accounts (to favor blue check accounts)
- The interface doesn't work for following high volume accounts.

Overall I'm getting a very negative vibe from Twitter these days (the way I used to feel about Facebook in 2014s). So, as in the past, I'll now be experimenting with quitting. I do this in batches. First I leave for a few weeks, then I come back and see if life was better or worse for the lack of Twitter. Then I take a call on leaving permanently or not.

This is not about Elon Musk or Mastodon. Neither of those are good enough reasons to leave a social media.

It is about the cost-benefit analysis.
