##### Some people think that using the word "vegetarian" and "non-vegetarian" is sensationalistic. So I compiled a list of either word being used in language. #####

* "**Vegetarians**, much less vegans, would prefer not to be compelled to eat meat. Yet the reverse compulsion is what lurks in the growing proposals for a new plant-based “planetary diet.” Nowhere is this more visible than in India." - [India Shows Why the Global Shift to Plant-Based Diets Is Dangerous](https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/india-shows-why-the-global-shift-to-plant-based-diets-is-dangerous/250958/)
* "**Vegetarians** in India shouldnt make policy recommendations or nutrition advice. Most of them give false messages damaging even good eating practices. Vegetarians are often on a mission to prevent meat eating by others....its not based on science." - [tweet](https://twitter.com/sakie339/status/1165926640347533312)
* "When a majority of people in Karnataka are **non-vegetarian** and when government funds are being given to Akshaya patra, should they be allowed to make diktats on what should and should not be given in their meals?" - [What ‘Egg-zactly’ Is the Problem with ISKCON’s Mid Day Meals?](https://drsylviakarpagam.wordpress.com/2017/08/21/what-egg-zactly-is-the-problem-with-iskcons-mid-day-meals/)
* "[Most Indians **Non Vegetarian**; Men More Than Women, South & East Most ](https://aharanammahakku.home.blog/2019/01/31/most-indians-non-vegetarian-men-more-than-women-south-east-most/)"
* "According to a study by the Anthropological Survey of India, more than 80% of Indian population is **non-vegetarian**." - [Is Eating Meat Indian Culture? It Always Has Been ](https://aharanammahakku.home.blog/2019/02/01/is-eating-meat-indian-culture-it-always-has-been/)
* "Going by National Family Health Survey, the National Sample Survey Organisation data, the India Human Development Survey(IHDS) **Vegetarians** are only 20% of population in India –but vegetarian is the main food –PDS, ICDS, MDM, hostels, relief (only rice), -even that is not being given" - [pdf](https://ccl.nls.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Brief-Report-Webinar-on-Right-to-Food-and-Caste-in-the-context-of-COVID-19.pdf)
