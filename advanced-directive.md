title: Advanced Directive
excerpt: What to do in case of my incapacity
permalink: advanced-directive/

In the event of me developing a psychiatric condition, it is difficult for my caretakers to choose a management strategy because "lack of insight" is a feature of many conditions and my distrust of society in general makes it very likely that I will not believe anyone who tells me that I need medications. Therefore, today, on the 25th of July, 2021, I make this advanced directive as to how to proceed in such situations.

If a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder is made, with agreement by my proxy decision maker, I can be given any evidence-based pharmacological mode of treatment. Covert administration of medication may be the first choice of treatment. Physical restraint and involuntary admission can be considered next. Any of these can only be used with the consent of my proxy decision maker.

If a diagnosis not included above, but with "lack of insight" as a symptom with medical consensus, is diagnosed the proxy decision maker may take any appropriate course of management.

In the event that I make this advanced directive (this webpage) unavailable through any means, but it can still be accessed through archive.org, then this advanced directive will continue to apply for at least 60 days from the day it has become unavailable.
